<h1>FaithBook</h1>

<h2>About:</h2><br/>
Created as a place for people to come and either rant or praise anything and everything happening in the world. Anyone is welcome to read a random post as well as see fun information about the number of posts but creating/editing and deleting posts becomes available upon account creation.

<h2>Technologies:</h2><br/>
Created using HTML/JavaScript/CSS with the help of Express, Mongoose/MongoDB, JSX/React and bcrypt. This full CRUD application makes use of Models/Views/Controllers and the 7 RESTful routes (and then some). 

<h2>Ideas for future installments:</h2><br/>
-A toggle for profanity filter - I don't like the idea of censoring people... but having an option for anyone who wishes to have profanity hidden/starred out would be nice.
-A way to search posts by ID and/or a favorite system where you can view posts that you've favorited (potentially in the same place as you view your own posts)
